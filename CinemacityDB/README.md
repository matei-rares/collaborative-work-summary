This is an SQL database made with the purpose to follow the rules of a cinema (many movies that are displayed in different rooms throught the day ).
A PyQt GUI has been added for a end-user that wants to buy one or more tickets for one of the available movies in the database, at a specific hour. 
This graphic interface also helps the database to fullfill some requirements because in simple SQL you cannot, for example, substract a seat when a ticket is bought (But in PLSQL you can do that because ⭐triggers⭐).
Oh, and there is that folder with PLSQL scripts that adds some logic (i.e. a transaction) but that part does not have a GUI so it's not that interesting (i'm joking, just to be clear).
